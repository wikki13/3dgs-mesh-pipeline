# 3dgs-mesh-pipeline
A complete end-to-end pipeline for converting point cloud (.ply) data into high-quality 3D meshes using Open3D’s 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework. The project includes preprocessing, 3DGS initialization, optimization, mesh extraction, and export for real-time use in Unity.
